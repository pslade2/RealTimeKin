The OpenSenseRT System is a project using open-source software and hardware to compute the motions of body segments based on inertial measurement unit (IMU) data using the processing power of a microcontroller worn on the body. The architecture can be customized to track specified body segments. The components are off-the-shelf and cost approximately $120 for base components and $20 for each tracked body segment. This page aims to help replicate the system for use in other studies. For full technical details, please [read our paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.24.436725v1) and check out our [replication guide](https://simtk-confluence.stanford.edu:8443/display/OpenSim/Wearable+and+Real-time+Kinematics+Estimates+with+OpenSense). The hardware can be assembled with common hand tools and does not require coding or soldering. We’ve created a [video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9cg7VGpuxHU) to demonstrate the system and the setup process. Check out the [example demonstrations video!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYc-mX_-NAA)
